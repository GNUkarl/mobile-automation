Here are four simple Selendroid tests for the Android Simple.com app to serve as a small demonstration of my skill with Anrdoid app testing


These require the following jars to run:

- Selendroid-client and Selendroid-standalone
	- http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|selendroid

- JUnit.jar and hamcrest-core.jar
	- https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Install


So far these tests have just been run with the Eclipse IDE JUnit plugin, but these could easily be added to Jenkins or some other CI.
